The purpose of this assignment is to utilize Python (matplotlib / scikit-learn) and R (ggplot2) modules to create **linear regression models** of a dataset comparing Salary to Years of Experience and vizualize the results.

We will be making enhancements on assignment two to include MSE in our model and additional annotations to our plot output files (PNG).


Additionally, in this assignment we will explore new GitHub functions:
-Branching
-Cloning
-Staging
-Merging
-Tagging
