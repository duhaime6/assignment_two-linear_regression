README

The purpose of this assignment is to utilize Python (matplotlib / scikit-learn) and R (ggplot2) modules to create **linear regression models** of a dataset comparing Salary to Years of Experience and vizualize the results.


PART I

I **created python and R notebooks** with markdown to explain my code, exported those as **.html files**, and made an initial commit to a new **git repo**: "https://github.com/duhaime6/assignment_two-linear_regression".


PART II

I exported **executable scripts** for both python and R, modified those scripts to **accept arguments**, ran the scripts in jupyterlab terminal generating **.png output files**, and committed the **scripts and .pngs** to the same git repo as Part I.
